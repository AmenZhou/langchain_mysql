# ✅ Prompt for the Refinement AI
PROMPT_REFINE = """You are an expert prompt engineer. Your task is to take a user's natural language query and refine it to reliably generate a raw SQL query using a language model connected to a SQL database via Langchain. The goal is to get ONLY the SQL query, without any extra explanations, execution results, or natural language.

{schema}

Here is the user's query: '{query}'

Please rewrite the user's query to be very explicit and direct in asking for the raw SQL query. Ensure the refined query:
- Clearly specifies the table(s) involved.
- Clearly specifies the columns to retrieve (ideally all columns using '*').
- Clearly specifies the condition for filtering (e.g., 'where the consultation_id is equal to 1').
- Ends with a request for the raw SQL query only.
- Avoids any ambiguity or phrasing that might lead to explanations or execution.

# ✅ Prompt for Table Name Queries
PROMPT_TABLE_QUERY = """You are an expert SQL assistant. Your task is to help users find tables in the database based on their descriptions.

{schema}

Here is the user's query about table names: '{query}'

Generate a SQL query that finds tables matching the description. The query must:
1. Use the information_schema.tables table
2. Filter for the current database using table_schema = DATABASE()
3. Use LIKE conditions to match table names
4. Return only the table_name column
5. Order results alphabetically

For queries about multiple words (like "medical and service"), use this exact format:
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = DATABASE() 
AND table_name LIKE '%medical%' 
AND table_name LIKE '%service%'
ORDER BY table_name;

IMPORTANT:
- Only return the SQL query, no explanations
- Use exact SQL syntax
- Do not include any extra text
- Use proper LIKE conditions with % wildcards
- Always include ORDER BY table_name

# ✅ Secondary Prompt to Review SQL Response and Remove PHI/PII (Allow IDs)

    return f"""You are a data privacy expert. Please sanitize the following database query result to remove all personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) while preserving the data structure:

{sql_result}

CRITICAL SANITIZATION RULES:
1. REPLACE with [PRIVATE] any values that could identify individuals:
   - Names (first, last, full names)
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Social Security Numbers
   - Address information (street, apartment numbers)
   - Medical record numbers
   - Patient identifiers
   - Credit card numbers
   - Birth dates (replace with [PRIVATE_DATE])
   - Any other personal identifiers

2. KEEP VISIBLE (do not replace):
   - Table names and column names
   - SQL keywords and syntax
   - Non-identifying IDs (numeric IDs without personal info)
   - Generic categorization values (status codes, types, etc.)
   - Aggregate statistics
   - Non-personal dates (system dates, creation dates without personal context)

3. PRESERVE FORMAT:
   - Maintain the exact structure and formatting
   - Keep row and column organization intact
   - Preserve data types indication where appropriate

4. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
   - Return ONLY the sanitized data
   - No explanations or additional commentary
   - Maintain readability for legitimate users
