## Detailed Changes

### Schema Understanding and Query Processing Improvements

1. **Enhanced Schema Extraction**
   - The `SchemaExtractor` class now captures comprehensive table information:
     - Column details including name, type, nullability, and default values
     - Primary key constraints
     - Foreign key relationships with detailed reference information
     - Index information for performance optimization
   - Improved error handling with detailed logging for schema extraction failures
   - Better table descriptions that include relationship information

2. **Improved Schema Vectorization**
   - The `SchemaVectorizer` class now creates more detailed document representations:
     - Each table's schema is converted into a rich document with:
       - Column descriptions including types and constraints
       - Foreign key relationships explicitly stated
       - Table relationships clearly documented
     - Documents include metadata for better context during query processing
   - Enhanced error handling during vector store initialization
   - Better logging for tracking schema processing

3. **Advanced Vector Store Management**
   - The `VectorStoreManager` class provides:
     - Persistent storage of schema information using FAISS
     - Efficient similarity search for relevant schema information
     - Separate storage for prompts and schema information
     - Asynchronous operations for better performance
   - Improved error handling and logging throughout the process

4. **Query Processing Improvements**
   - Better understanding of table relationships through:
     - Explicit foreign key relationship storage
     - Detailed column type information
     - Table relationship descriptions
   - Enhanced error handling for:
     - Empty queries
     - Uninitialized vector stores

### FAISS Implementation Details

1. **Core Functionality**
   - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used for efficient similarity search and clustering
   - Enables fast retrieval of relevant schema information for natural language queries
   - Provides persistent storage of vectorized schema data

2. **Implementation Features**
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of schema embeddings
   - Fast nearest neighbor search capabilities
   - Support for high-dimensional vectors
   - Persistent storage with local file system integration

3. **Technical Integration**
   ```python
   # Vector store initialization
   self.schema_vectordb = FAISS.load_local(
       self.persist_directory, 
       self.embeddings,
       allow_dangerous_deserialization=True
   )
   ```
   - Seamless integration with our schema vectorization system
   - Efficient similarity search for schema information
   - Support for both CPU and GPU implementations

4. **Benefits**
