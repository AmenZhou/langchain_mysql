     - `data`: Execute the SQL query and return the results
     - `natural_language`: Generate natural language explanation of the query and results
     - `all`: Return SQL, data, and natural language explanation combined

2. **Enhanced Query Processing**

     - `sql`: The generated SQL query
     - `data`: The data returned from executing the SQL query
     - `explanation`: Natural language explanation of the results
     - `response_type`: The type of response that was returned

4. **Error Handling**
   - Added specific error handling for execution and explanation failures

These enhancements provide more flexibility and value to the API consumers, allowing them to choose the most appropriate response format for their use case.

## 05/13/2025

### Changed
- Refactored `SchemaExtractor` to accept an optional `inspector` object in its constructor. This allows for more direct injection of mock inspectors during testing, improving test stability and simplifying test setup by removing the need for complex patching of `sqlalchemy.inspect`.
- Internal methods of `SchemaExtractor` (e.g., `get_all_tables`, `extract_table_schema`) now use a new `self.inspector` property, which either returns the injected inspector or lazily creates one from the engine.
- Updated unit tests for `SchemaExtractor` (`test_schema_basic.py`, `test_schema_extractor.py`, `test_schema_vectorizer.py`) to align with the `SchemaExtractor` refactor, by passing a `mock_inspector` directly during `SchemaExtractor` instantiation.
- Corrected document content generation in `SchemaExtractor.create_schema_documents` to match test expectations, ensuring consistent output for schema representations.
- Fixed import path errors in `test_server.py` related to patching `AsyncOpenAI` by using an absolute module path.
- Stabilized `test_query_endpoint_exists` in `test_server.py` by using FastAPI's `app.dependency_overrides` for the `get_langchain_mysql` dependency, providing a more robust mocking mechanism for endpoint tests.
- Successfully resolved all previously failing and skipped tests, resulting in a fully passing test suite.
